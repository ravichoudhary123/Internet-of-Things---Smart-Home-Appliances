On Raspberry Pi run:
$python temperature.py.
This starts to read temperature sensor and writes the values to a file

At the gateway, start the server code that waits for incoming connections:
$/gtk-server1.c 

In another terminal at raspberry pi run :
$./rfcomm-client1.c
This will start the Bluetooth client which sends the temperature data from temperature sensor to gateway.

When the connection is made between client and server the smart node can be monitored and the data transfer takes place between
server and client

In another terminal at gateway run:
$python parseSample.py
This reads the temperature sensor values at the gateway and uploads it to the parse server which can be accessed using a remote device
like iPad
